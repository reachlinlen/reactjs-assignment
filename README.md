INTRO
The app has the form for receiving Transaction details of three users - USEAR A, USER B, USER C. The banks involved in the transactions include 'American Express', 'DBS Paylah!' and 'Visa'. 
The transactions are stored in a reducer of Redux Saga and updated in the stores as the transactions happen.
The Table below the form shows the transactions and updated as and when the transactions happen
Simiarly, the line chart has been connected to stores and hence, the chart gets updated as the transaction happens.
Currently, one transaction has been kept per page for demo purpose and it can be changed as the app dev work is completed.
